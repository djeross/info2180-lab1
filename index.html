		<p>My name is Rodje Ross. I am a second year student majoring in computer science.<br>
			I chose computer science as my major because after evaluating my likes, strenghts and<br>
			subject selection, I came to the conclusion that it was the only thing I was "half-good" at.<br>
			Now that I am in year two and I am preparing for the working world, I have select courses
			that are very essential In the IT sector. After assesing various company requirements<br> 
			for an entry level job in almost every field, it was evident that the skill of web programming<br>
			is a must have. This was the catalyst in my decision to take part in the web development course.
